### Hi! I'm Rian, and this is supposed to be a sort of CV, but it's actually just a collection of links to social networks:

Flavor one: edgy student - <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rian-l-125b83168/>

Flavor two: ranting gamer/ software engineer - Check out NANASHI0x74 (@nanashi0x74): <https://twitter.com/nanashi0x74?s=09>

#### I feel like I should say a bit more stuff about me:
- I've been enjoying tinkering with electronic devices since I was little
- I do sports, parcours, Karate and French Boxing
- I'm bilingual (english/german)
- I the next two languages I intend on learning are:
    1. spanish
    2. irish gaelic
- I really want to learn how to web design and how to javascript, but I used Markdown to build this within like an hour, so we'll have to live with that. Cool? Cool. ^^ (maybe it was more than an hour, would have to look that up in the commit history, but I'm too lazy for that. Also, I was using only my phone ðŸ˜€)
